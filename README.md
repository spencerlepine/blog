## Publishing Articles

Create a new folder with the article markdown file and thumbnail image. Docusuarus will automatically deploy this to GitHub Pages.

```
/content
  /new-article-folder-name
    index.md
    thumbnail.jpg
```

### Cross-Posting

Once you have published an article to the GitHub Pages blog, you can cross-post the article to Medium or Dev.to with very little additional effort.

Open the following workflows on GitHub, and enter the folder name when triggering a
[manual dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow#configuring-a-workflow-to-run-manually):

- Dev.to: https://github.com/spencerlepine/blog/actions/workflows/post-to-dev-to.yml
- Medium: https://github.com/spencerlepine/blog/actions/workflows/post-to-medium.yml

```sh
$ yarn install

```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
