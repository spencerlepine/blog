Every time I clone a repository from GitHub, I always run the same set of commands. This is prone to typos and simply inconvenient. There is a simple solution of combining each step into a single command that automatically runs everything for us.

In this example, I need to clone a GitHub repository, move into the new directory, and then open the project in VSCode.

Instead of multiple commands:
```sh
  git clone https://github.com/spencerlepine/readme-crawler
  cd readme-crawler
  code .
```
It would great to run one command:
```sh
	clone https://github.com/spencerlepine/readme-crawler
```

To achieve this, we can create a script in the ```~/bin``` directory. Make sure this path matches up with your configuration for the terminal (e.g. ```PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin```).

Let’s create a custom script to combine the git commands.

```sh
  #!/bin/bash

  ((!$#)) && echo missing git URL argument! && exit 1

  git clone $1
  basename=$(basename $1)
  reponame=${basename%.*}
  cd $reponame
  npm install
  code .
```

Use this script or create your own, and follow these steps to set up the custom command:

- Navigate to usr/local/bin -> ```cd ~/../../usr/local/bin```
- Run ```vim clone```
  - *Paste the script*
- Save the file:
  - *press ‘ESC’
  - *press ‘SHIFT’ + ‘:’
  - *type ‘wq’ + ENTER
- Create an executable
  - ```chmod +x clone```
- Run the command!
  - ```clone https://github.com/spencerlepine/manyshiba-bot.git```

Viola! This script will accept one command line argument of the destination repo URL. It will automatically open the new project in VSCode in one command.
